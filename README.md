Let's (finally) learn some Machine Learning!!

Within this repo, you will find all the resources I’m using to master Machine Learning. I plan to cover a wide range of topics, starting from a more practical angle and gradually moving toward the theoretical foundations in math, statistics, and computer science. Feel free to reach out with suggestions, advice, or just to chat about it!
